Application in Jetpack Compose using the Open Weather API

After the Jetpack Compose course it was time to really learn and hence start developing an app (based on MarsPhotos initially to use the correct architecture). 
Since you can experiment with the OpenWeather API for free (limited traffic and signup is needed) at https://openweathermap.org/api, I decided to give it a spin to create an app. 
Currently it does not have a design, its just stretching my wings on the concepts and getting things working.
